# Backend-ansible

Ansible scripts for Linux hosts running Eth Docker patterned repos in Docker

## Run Playbook

1. Copy `production/inventory.sample.yml` to `production/inventory.yml` and modify as necessary.

2. Copy `production/group_vars/all.sample.yml` variables file to `production/group_vars/all.yml` and update as necessary.

> Note: The `deploy.yml` playbook assumes you use SSH bastion hosts. If that is not so, edit it accordingly.

3. Replace the variables as required in file copied `backend-ansible/production/group_vars/main.yml`

4. Run ansible playbook:

      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i production/inventory.yml deploy.yml
      ```

## Playbooks

- `deploy.yml`: Set up a new server, optionally with repos like traefik and Eth Docker
- `update.yml`: Update all repos on a server, or a specific repo by name by passing -e "repo=myrepo"
- `bookworm.yml`: Update a Debian 11 "bullseye" server to Debian 12 "bookworm" 

### Targeting specific hosts

The `--limit` argument allows you to target a specific host from the inventory.

```shell
ansible-playbook -i production/inventory.yml --limit=mytarget.example.com deploy.yml
```

If you want to check what hosts have been selected by the filter, you can add the `--list-hosts` argument.

```shell
ansible-playbook -i production/inventory.yml --limit=mytarget.example.com --list-hosts deploy.yml
```

### Extra URLS to send metrics and logs
To send metrics/logs to other endpoints apart from our local loki/mimir stack, new URLs are added to prometheus and loki `custom-*.yml` files. Check on `roles/base/custom_prometheus_loki` for the implementation and templates of config updates.

This can be used to send metrics and logs to any other server as needed by changing the URLs in `all.yml` specifically below

```yml
extra_send_metrics_logs:
  sending_to_1:
    servers_hostnames: ["all"]
    metrics:
      url: https://METRICS_URL_1111
      username: METRICS_USERNAME_1111
      password: METRICS_PASSWORD_1111
    logs:
      url: https://LOGS_URL_1111
      username: LOGS_USERNAME_1111
      password: LOGS_PASSWORD_1111
      operator: LOGS_OPERATOR_1111
  sending_to_2:
    servers_hostnames: ["server1", "server2"]
    metrics:
      url: https://METRICS_URL_2222
      username: METRICS_USERNAME_2222
      password: METRICS_PASSWORD_2222
    logs:
      url: https://LOGS_URL_2222
      username: LOGS_USERNAME_2222
      password: LOGS_PASSWORD_2222
      operator: LOGS_OPERATOR_2222
  sending_to_3:
    servers_hostnames: ["all"]
    logs:
      url: https://LOGS_URL_3333
      username: LOGS_USERNAME_3333
      password: LOGS_PASSWORD_3333
      operator: LOGS_OPERATOR_3333
```
